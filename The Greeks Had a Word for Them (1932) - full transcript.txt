The flower shop, please. I'll wait. Schatzi? Schatzi! What do you want? We've got to go now. You better get dressed. I'll be ready. Well, you'd better be. It'd be terrible if we missed it this evening. Oh, Polaire, I'm dressed to go out right now. The flower shop? Mr. Harris? Listen, Mr. Harris, my girlfriend's fianc? ? sent her some more of those orchids, Mr. Harris. Six of them. Beautiful. Yes, but Mr. Harris, you paid us twice as much for six of them last week. You mean, not even stockbrokers aren't buying orchids anymore, Mr. Harris? Well, alright, Mr. Harris. Oh, I'll send them right down. Hurry up, Schatzi. I am hurrying. Now, listen, Pops, and I'll tell you. I just took the money you gave me for the car and bought some more American telentel instead. Yeah, Pops, you know, a car goes out of style, but telentel goes on forever. Oh, I didn't know you were in the shower. Did you have a good time with Oscar and the medicine ball? Well, anyhow, Jean gets back today. Yeah, Jeanie. Yeah, I know you don't think she's in my class, but you'll have to admit, she's awful good company. Yeah. Besides, she's awful broke. And you know what I think, Pops? I think her stocks went down. And there she was in Paris and didn't know how to say 'sell short' in French. And anyhow, her fianc?'s wife arrived. And it seems that she's a very narrow-minded person. And she bought him his ticket, so Jean decided to come home. Yeah, and she's on the island of France and ought to be in in about an hour. Your bill, madame. Bill? What for? For the liquor, madame. Forty-three dollars! You said forty-three dollars? You're going to make me believe... ... that I have drunk forty-three dollars worth of liquor since I've been on this boat? Oh, no, madame. These are only the drinks you haven't paid for yet. You mean, there are drinks somebody else paid for. - Well, yes, madame. - But I haven't paid for any drinks myself. That was my point, madame. Well, don't let it throw you. This can be arranged. - I'll send Hemming over. - Bye. Thank you, sir. - Pardon me - - Haven't I met you someplace before? Oh, that's possible. I have been on this boat for five days. No, I don't mean that. No, I've seen you somewhere before. Was it the races? - The races? Perhaps... - I know it was somewhere. St. Cloud. That's where it was. I couldn't forget easily a good-looking man like you. You know, it's the silliest thing. My stupid maid has packed my trunks and I have a foul bill here... I'm sure she must've packed my checkbook. Anyway, I can't find it. I wonder if - - Oh, you must allow me. - Oh, no, I couldn't think of that! - My dear, how much is it? - No, I couldn't really. Forty-three dollars. Oh, I feel terribly. What if we make it sixty? I always believe in tipping admirably, don't you? Oh, yes. You're so kind. - There she is! - Hello! Jean! Do my eyes deceive me or is she really alone? And without a man. I think she's afraid of catching colds. Will you kindly take your suitcase out of the small of my back? I beg your pardon. I didn't know it was the small of your back. Well, you're a stranger to me, and that's the small of my back to you. - There she is! - Hey, Jean! - Jean! - Hello, babies! I'm back to New York and I'm so happy to see you guys! Oh, we've missed you, haven't we, Schatzi? Oh, I'll say we missed you. We wanted you to come home ages ago, like you promised. Oh, I had a terrible time in Paris. Oh, do you hear that? She said she had a terrible time. Trunks, ladies? No, no trunks. What do you mean no trunks? I mean the hotel in Paris thought they needed them worse than I did. Oh, well, what you need is a good drink. Come on up to my place and have one. - Bet you could do with a little drinking. - You bet I could. You know, when they close these ship's bars, you're so shut off from liquor! - Oh, no! - They ought to! Broke? Am I broke! - Oh, poor Jean. - Yeah, I'll say. Well, just as long as you're back. Yes, we'll have fun anyhow, Jean. Well, I could do with some fun. They got all my clothes except what I got on. And what's in that little black bag I sneaked out of them. And all my bracelets, except that one I sneaked out on them, too... ... because I couldn't see letting them see the real ones. I got nothing I can call my own except my health. - Any wonder I wanted to see you guys? - No, no. It's no wonder. Hey, that's my old comb! - What's your comb? - That's my comb! - That's my old comb. - Did you two start fussing already? Well, now that we three are together, we can put up our feet and make a few plans. Plans? What for? For you. We can lend you clothes and we can lend you money. - Huh? - That is, some. But the first thing to do is to put you back in the swim. I'll tell you what I'll do, Jean. I'll lend you my good luck bracelet that you've always wanted. - Good! - You can wear it til I change it. And the luck will change, too, because I've had my bad dimes turned on it. You know, I can't keep things with a hole in it. Oh, but it won't happen on a bad dime. Why not? Mine looks alright. Oh, you're a sport! You can keep anything. Why bother? I know what I'll do, Polaire. Tomorrow I'll take it down to Carmen's... ... and have your bad diamond sawed off and put in a permanent case with diamonds in it. Well, that's certainly sweet of you, Jean. Not a bean in the world, and talking about diamonds! You know, I don't believe I could've had any better friends than you two guys. And I want you to know that you haven't got any better friend than I am. Oh, that's sweet of you to say that. Do you hear that? Sweet. And as long as we three stick together, I don't care what happens. I'll just get even wilder. And we wouldn't have broken up, only I had to go fall in love... We won't break up again, not if I can help it. Cause you know that I'm for you, and I know that you're for me... ... and there's no friends like old friends. - Just the three of us. - Against the men! All the playgirls of New York! And now for our plans... What are you going to do? Just a moment. Don't you worry about Little Jean. She's going to be alright. Why, I was just saying to myself this morning as I looked out at that old skyline... 'Well, that's it. If the worst comes to the worst, there's always Pops.' There's always Pops. Pops? Sure! Pops! Oh, you remember Pops! Oh, sure, we remember Pops. What's the matter? Pops isn't dead, I hope! No, Pops isn't dead. Maybe I ought to give Pops a ring and let him know I'm back. Just to prepare him. Oh, no, dear, no. I wouldn't do that, not if I were you. No, Jean, she's right. That isn't the thing to do at all. Well, why not? Hello? That you, Pops? Yeah, Jean's here. Guess I'd better call you back. - Say, what's Pops to you? - Now, isn't Pops a father to all of us? Hey, what's Pops to you? Well, you wouldn't expect a nice girl like me to leave a kind, old gentlemen like Pops... ... in the old Metropolitan Club without a thing to call his own! You answer my question. What's Pops to you? Well, he's my fianc?. Not that we're engaged, or anything like that. Well, you would fall in love and go away! Well, this is a fine welcome home! Looting the only man who was ever kind to me. And promised to remember me in his will. I never have any luck. There's one thing that's certain, though. At Pop's age, you won't have him long! Now, you'll wish Pops no bad luck, if you don't mind. And now we'll have Polaire call up Dey Emery and have him throw a party for you tonight. And have him bring along some nice friend of his who is fun... ... who would like to meet a nice girl who is fun, too. You don't mind doing that for Jean, do you, Polaire? Sure, I'll call him. Give me Worcestershire... No, nevermind. Well, there's one thing that has got to be understood before Jean meets any friend of mine. And that is, she's got to lay off him. Now, why bring that up? Because you never lay off anybody who belongs to someone else. - Oh, is that so? - You never want anyone else to have any fun. Oh, is that so! So you don't meet any friend of mine until you sign a paper saying you've changed your habits. I'll change any habits of mine that don't suit you, the day you change your face for one I can stand! You don't have to stand anything about me anymore than I do about you, you poor, blonde wop! - You call me a blonde wop? - Stop it, both of you! - She can't help it if she's Italian! - You dirty, little - - Oh, I did, of course. - See? Well, she may have started it, but you gave a good cause. Oh, you always take her side. I take the side of the party that's right, and you know it. Yeah? If you don't stop scrappling, I'll send you both home. It's undignified. - Ms. Big Mouth! - You scubbleraff! Look what you did to her! It's hers anyhow! Now get her a towel and wipe that beer off. Alright, now see if there's anything besides beer in this joint. Yeah! Oh, my goodness, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, fighting about a man you haven't met yet. How do you even think to get into a scrapple all the time? Oh, well, I always think she was on the level, and more fun than - Well, I always said you were more fun, too, as far as that goes. Well, I'm not anymore. I'm broke and disillusioned, and that makes me bitter. Well, one thing, no one can pan either one of you to the other. Oh, well, you can have my good luck bracelet anyhow, Jean. - I'll give you my red fox fur. - Oh, that's sweet! Anyhow! - You will call Dey Emery, won't you? - Sure I will. Tell him not to bring any of his old mates. Get a regular guy or nothing. Having girl trouble, Dey? Girl trouble? No, Father, why? You've rolled your dice, but you haven't moved your men. Oh, I'm sorry, Father. Six to the five, aha. - Alright, double you. - Take it. Yes, you rang for here? The telephone for Mr. Dey, sir. Telephone... telephone. Tell them he'll call back. - It's a lady, sir. - Of course it is. It's always a lady. - I believe it's 'the' lady, Mr. Dey. - You'll have to excuse me, Father. Hello? Oh, hello, darling. Listen, darling, will you be sweet and give us a party tonight? Of course. I'd love to! Well, now, you've got to bring along someone nice for Jean. Who will you get? I'm not going to tell you now. Wait til you meet him. Goodbye, darling. - Wild oats, Billings. Wild oats. - They're only young once, sir. I haven't forgotten. Your play. If you had the sense you were born with, you would've given me that red dress back. Say, if you owe me five pairs at sixteen dollars each. Oh, will you quit scrabbling and shut up! Shut up yourself. Every time I lend you a pair, you manage to get something stuck in it - You keep talking about stockings! When I think of the champagne I lent her... Where's my ermine coat? Your ermine coat... Yeah, you borrowed it from me last winter and didn't give it back. - You gave it to me! - I lent it to you. You gave it to me for Christmas! I lent it to you for Christmas. - Hello. - Please, to a table. How about right here? Well, what have you done on your trip? They'll kill us, blind us, or burn holes in our clothing. - They've got good cordon rouge here. - Yes, expensive. - Did I ask you the price of it? - No, you didn't. If you don't know who I am, you better ask the other waiters. Now, put some champagne on ice, then bring the ladies over. Yes. Where are these friends of yours? Unhappy to be kept waiting in speakeasies. You know, I can call up five-minute girls, here, London, Paris, Berlin... Have four hundred and fifty here in half an hour. You won't though, will you? Well, I hope you didn't think that was an idle boast. As long as it wasn't a threat, I don't care. Well, I've got the three best bets on the whole West Side for you tonight... ... and my own girl's one of them, so give them a break. Well, don't think that I'm unanxious to meet them. Variety, you know, is the spice of life. - Well, there we are. - Well, where are they? I think you'll find the ladies at the bar. Please! You are a large volumen. - ... at six hundred. - Five hundred! - What's that? - Somebody you'd be crazy to meet. - Well, tell me. - Surprise! - Oh, tell. - You'll see. Well, here we are. Schatzi, Jean, and Polaire. Always together, thicker than thieves, and out for no good. I call them the Three Musketeers of Riverside Drive. - Faith. - Hope. - Charity. - Ta-da! - You should be on the stage. - Oh, we've been. - Ladies of folly. - Yeah, plenty of folly! Oh, we've been glorified. If it hadn't been for Mr. Frenchman, we'd all be married and settled down. - You're Mr. Emery, aren't you? - Yes. - Yes, I've seen you often at the races. - The races? Oh, maybe it was the polo. I wouldn't forget you. You are good-looking, you know. Yes, isn't he? - Yes, I never forget a face. I'll sit by you. - Only that happens to be my place. Alright, alright. I don't see why you have to be so fussy. Beggars can't be choosers. Any old port will be fine. Shall you introduce me, Dey, or shall I do that for myself? Not unless you insist. I always like to know who I'm talking to. You mean to say you didn't know he was Boris Feldman? No, I didn't. Wherever are the refreshments? Well, how about this? - That's the best you've got. - Allow me. Thanks. Caviar? Don't speak of food while I'm drinking my dinner. I'll just take a sandwich if you don't mind. A large club. - The lady will have a large club. - One large club. Anything for me, old man. I'm having mine. - Well, what do you do? - I play the piano. Is that all? Well, I took tambourine lessons, but I gave them up when I was very young. Oh, dear, a comic as well. He happens to play a little better than anyone else in the world. - You've heard me? - Why shouldn't I have heard you? I'm allowed in public places. I thought you two could get together about music. I take piano lessons myself, Mr. Feldman. I just love music. Yeah, I hate it. - You'll like mine. - We shall see. Oh, quit scrappling, Jean. Don't spoil the party. - I'm going home. - Oh, no, no, no. I don't know where home is, but I know I'll find it a lot quicker by myself... ... than I will hanging around you two false blushers. I come back from Paris after all I've been through... ... and you talk big about helping me get a new start in life. And the best you can offer me is a piano player! Oh, Jean, for Pete's sake! Piano player, that's a good one! - Not a piano player. A pianist, please. - Well, same thing to me. Yeah, but this piano player happens to get paid twenty-five hundred dollars every time he plays. How often do you play? Well, never less than three, never more than four times a week. Three or four times a week at twenty-five - Well! I'm not too proud to apologize! - You've made the party! - Well, now that we've got that point settled... - Not bad, this, eh? - I'll tell you more about it in the morning. You can tell an awful lot about the liquor you drink the night before... ... by where you find your hat the next morning. - So your first name's Jean. - That's the first name, yes. - What year were you in the follies? - Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. But it was years and years ago. I want to talk to you in the bar. Quite a pleasure. Boris Feldman is a great fellow. - Wasted on Jean. - Jean's wasted on him. - So it seems. - That's the point, isn't it, darling? I'd like to say something first though. Well, go on and say it. - You're Italian, aren't you? - You must be a traveling man. In a way. But I know women. A blonde Italian is the most beautiful thing on earth. - Are you Russian? - Russian from the Bronx. Oh, say! Hello, Pops. Did you call me up? No, I'm not at home. I'm with Jean and Polaire. Where? Oh, in a sort of a dress store. You know my trouble, more than anything else in the world? Well, it might be your income tax, and it might be your waistline. Neither. Getting rid of the women who fall in love with me. - No! - I'm serious. Women who love me and won't let me go. Oh, how do you count for that? Well, in every man's life, he has one dream that he's sure will never come true. He dreams that there's always some woman somewhere who will say... 'Nothing ever lasts. I knew this wouldn't... But I never had anything like it before, so good luck, and goodbye.' Are you leading up to calling me your dreamgirl? I may be. - But you're going to fall in love with me. - No, tell me more. I'm going to play just for you. - Play the piano? - I'll tell you. If you don't fall in love with me after I play for you tonight... ... you can take the price of a mink coat home with you. Five thousand dollars, what do you say? Is it a bet? And what do I get if I win? Well, that has its prize, too. Anything, everything. Oh! I'll take you up! Waiter, I'm looking for a place to wash my hands. There's a room there, for gentlemen. But don't let that stop you. You go right in. Pardon me, is that yours? Yes. Well, just to make it legal. You bet this against the mink coat. Is it done? Is it done? Mister, I'm human. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, two o'clock. Closing time. A speakeasy that closes at two o'clock is practically a tearoom. Well, I think we'll have to go before they put us out. Suits me, I've got a golf lesson at nine in the morning. - Is anyone getting up at nine in the morning? - Yes. - If you're going to be home. - Or do you want Boris to come to my place. - He'll give you a telephone call. - Where do you live? Central Park West. I think we'll go to my place. This is the way to listen to music. Just lying around, half-cockeyed, in the dark. That's the way to listen to anything. Music or a lad. This is the life, alright, only some people don't know it. Say, Dey, what do you think of Jean falling asleep on Feldman's playing... ... and now she's sleeping on Polaire's? Well, she said she didn't like piano players. I know, but that's a fine way to act when they invite you to their house! That's that. - Well, shall we have some lights? - Certainly, if it doesn't disturb your friend. What time is it? - Why, it's after four. - After four! Gee, I got to go home. I can't sit up all night listening to you play the piano! I've got a golf lesson at nine in the morning. I'll go upstairs and get my coat. When is Feldman's birthday? Gee, Polaire, you've been holding out on me. I didn't know you could really play. I can't, really. But you can, really. I knew you had something. I see you think I've got a pretty talented girl, Feldman. Yes, that's why I want to talk to her. I don't want to talk. I hate people who can talk. So do I. But tell me, where did you learn what you know about music? Somebody sat me down at a piano stool when I was a kid. What made you get up? That's a long story, and I hate long stories. Yeah! So do I. Come on, everybody, let's have a little drinky. Come into my study. I can talk to you better there. And we won't disturb your friend's slumber. Well! Perhaps a little more music might help. Well, I'll be - - I could make an artist of you. - No, you couldn't. - I haven't got the guts. - Now, don't talk like a fool. Why not? I am a fool. I've got just enough sense to realize that you're a divine artist which I object to. Well, why do you object? Because nothing that's divine is any fun. And anything that's not fun is out as far as I'm concerned. - Honey, come up here. - Oh, I'd rather not. Well, I'm not proud. Oh, lay off, Jean. Dey isn't njoying this any more than you are. Well, why doesn't he stand up for his rights, then, and do something? Rights? I haven't any rights. - Polaire's not my property. - Well, Feldman's mine. All the men to pick from, and you had to bring a piano player! What's wrong with that? - Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying. Anyway, I think this party's seen better days. Why don't we all go out somewhere for breakfast? Yes, well, I'm for that. I'd do anything to get that spell out of here. Playing the piano for my personal property! - I can make you work. - I tell you, I'm too lazy. I'm no good. I know I'm no good. If you're good enough for Boris Feldman, then you're good enough for the world. Would you kindly leave us alone? I just wanted to tell you that Mr. Emery's taking us all out to breakfast. Well, if he takes you out, I'll be perfectly satisfied. No man living can make a crack like that to me and get away with it. Dey, would you mind stepping into this office with us? Sure. I don't want to take advantage of my friends, Dey. But you're very fond of this girl. I've made her a proposition. Let her study with me for two years, and I'll make her rich and famous. Well! I don't see where that's taking advantage of me. She won't have me make her anything but notorious. I don't want to be famous, and I don't have to be rich. I never give advice except when I'm tight, so... I think you better take him up, and do what he tells you. Even if that washes up everything between you and me? Well, why does that follow? Doesn't it, Feldman? Obviously. She'll have to travel with my company, go on my tours. Spend her summers in Europe studying. Now, will you tell her that I can offer her more than you or will you stand in her way? Well, I don't want to stand in her way, but - Well, then maybe at some point, you'd mind stepping out of your way. I've chosen. I'm sad for him, but I may be of some use to myself. When do we start? Right away. That's a little sudden. No, it isn't. It's better to have everything straight like that. It's... simpler. - You are a sport, Dey. - Oh, that's alright. But, don't forget me, if you fall off the piano stool. None of that. You're mine now, and I'm jealous. Always in the course of a long evening, somebody always drinks a toast. Usually with less excuse than I've got. Well, here's to Polaire's future. Polaire's future? Why? Because she's promised to give me her hands. I did not say 'her hand'. And I'm going to help her to make them famous. He thinks he can teach me to play the piano well enough to get paid for it. She's promised to work. - I'll get you some coffee. - I'll help you. Thanks, no. I keep my coffee in the strangest places. Just a moment. Do I win that bet? What bet? Did you or did you not bet me a mink coat that you'd make me love you? I did. Well, you haven't made me. Five thousand dollars, didn't we say? Five thousand, yes. Count them yourself. That's what I call high, wide, and handsome. Handsome is as handsome does. - I'll even return your handkerchief. - You can keep that. Thanks, though. I didn't win it. I won much more. I can't remember when I've had a more profitable evening. - I'll be going home, I guess. - Wait a minute. I suppose you know you've made a little fool of yourself? I've always known that, my dear. Oh, yeah? Well, this party certainly dies a death. I'm going home. What's your hurry? I'm not thinking of going yet. Alright, then, take off your coat, and stick around awhile. I'm cold. Alright, keep it on, then. Come on, Dey, let's go in the kitchen and get some coffee. Cold? What's this? Well, when I did that, I was hot. Your messages have never been exactly subtle, have they? They usually work. Which one were you planning to ask for, Feldman or Dey? - My business. - I'm sorry, Jean. Can I help it if Feldman likes me? Try it on Dey. He's a swell guy. Oh, don't bother me. I'm busy. I thought you'd gone. I'm waiting for the Marines to drag me out. I've done my best to get rid of them. I'd rather you told them that I've gone home. You're shy. I like that. I'm just not used to letting people in on my business the way you do. - Where are you going? - I'm going home to get some things. Well, it's just ten minutes to five. I'll give you those ten minutes. I'll be back. No. Not while Dey's still here. Has she gone? - Yes, she's gone. - I'm going, too. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. - I suspect we may have overstayed our welcome. - You may be right there, too. Get your old hat and coat, Dey. I'll do that. Has Jean gone yet? Yes, she's gone home. - I wonder where that is. - I haven't the faintest idea. Well, no hard feelings, I hope, old man. Of course there are. Still, I'll wish you luck, since we may not meet again. - Good night. - Good night. 'Our program continues with Lucille Oliver, singing "Tossy's Goodbye".' Well! I came to give you back your five thousand. Why? Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies. Keep it. I didn't win it. Oh, yes, you did. You didn't try to make me love you, Feldman. Do you want me to? Well, I'm still here. Yes, I see you are. Let's have a little drink together, then I'll go. Oh, you, too? Sorry to hurry you, my dear, but... How many blonde Italians have you known? Only one. Oh, I'm hot! I wonder where my dress is. I did have a dress once. Pardon my appearance. I find it hard to. This is the most wonderful couch in the world. Mind if I stay here? Just what do you want? I want to take piano lessons. You won that bet. Did I? Did you want to win it? I'm afraid I did. Don't go. Let it ring. I'm sleepy. No. They'll go away. They're gone. How many people have come out of Mr. Feldman's apartment since I left? A lady and a gentleman, together. - Only one lady? - That's all, ma'am. - Take me down. - Yes. I like you, Dey. You don't take things too hard. Oh, I like you, too, Schatzi. - Thanks. Good night. - Good night. Driver, drive around the park. Drive around the park for awhile. - A pretty girl. - I'll say! Call an ambulance. Someone help me with this slide. Hello? Yeah, this is she. Who? Hospital? What hospital? Taxi accident? Is she hurt badly? I'll be right over. Well, it was a milkwagon. Either my driver was a drinking man, or he doesn't like milkwagons. I never should have let Jean have my bad dime. - I'll call Dey. - Oh, no. No, that's all washed-up. Well, where was Feldman? Yeah, that was too good to be true. Well, what are you going to do? Get well. Get my bad dime back. And get good and even! - Good and even with who? - With that big stiff Jean. - Jean? - Yes. She beat me to it. - Jean and Feldman. - What? I wonder how they'll get on! Well, I saw you asleep. Say, listen. I just called you up to tell you that from now on, I sleep when I please. And with or without music. Well, don't write. Wire. Emma? Come here. Take this address book and get on that telephone. We've got to see where we go from here. Yes, Ms. Jean. Where do I begin? Start at the beginning and go right through. I'm back in circulation. - Oh, come on, tell me! - What, my whole life story, again? No. Tell me what you hear from Schatzi and Polaire. I'd rather not go into that. I don't hear anything. What do you hear from Polaire? Oh, nothing. I thought she's where I saw her last, in Feldman's flat. Well, now that we've got that off our minds, what have you got in your hips? Well, I can't understand why he didn't get there. I'm sure he said lunch, and I waited as long as I could. I had this appointment at 3:30, you know. Well, if he comes in, ask him to call me here. I wouldn't worry if I were you. Life isn't so easy these days that a girl can afford not to worry. Well, isn't that voice Schatzi? I believe it is, miss. - Who's in that neckbow? - It's your friend, Ms. Lawrence. - Well, hello, you. - Hello, yourself. Where you been keeping yourself? Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. Where's Polaire? Ask you any questions you want to. I can keep my trap shut. How's Feldman? Oh, we parted. I knew that wouldn't last. It didn't suit me. Who did you have lunch with today? Well, what's it to you? Well, I don't know as it's anything to me... ... only I had a luncheon engagement with Pops and he didn't keep it. So a little snooping seems in order. The gentleman you spoke of is here, ma'am. - Ask him to wait. - Ask him to come in! This is my territory, Al Capone! Knowing you, you're only sure of that! - Oh, hello! You've met Mr. Emery, haven't you? - Oh, hello, Schatzi. - You know I've met him. - She thought you were Pops! I can't imagine why she's so fretful about Pops! Are you two playing around together now? Well, he's my fianc?, not that we're engaged or anything like that. - That's like you. - What is? Trying to take your best friend's man away from her. - And you don't look so hot either! - What do you mean? She gave him up, didn't she? Say, we're going out to have a little drinky. Won't you join us? Just wait til the 'Hearing From Me' department! Anything you've got to say about me, you say before me! I wouldn't say what I've got to say about you before anybody! Now, listen, young man, I've got news for you. And I'll think a lot less of you if it isn't news. I'm not supposed to tell you, but now that I see what that baby's up to... - Did you know that Polaire's been in the hospital? - What? Yeah! Ever since that night at Feldman's. - What hospital? Where? - St. Luke's Hospital! I'm sorry about that drink. I'm going! Hey! You can't get away with that! That because it's you... ... and this, because it's me. Well, I always new you were a prince, but I never dreamed you were such a glutton for punishment. The recipient places the ring on the usual finger and kisses the donor. Wait a minute. How do you know I won't walk out on you again? Well, I'll make you happy. You won't want to. If I don't, I deserve to lose you. Talk to your father first. Til then, I'm not holding you to any promises maid. Except one. What's that? That you still like me. Darling... - Well, we'll bury the hatchet. - And have a little drinky! - Well! - Alright, kid. Wow, I wonder what happened to Mary Queen and - - Yeah, she deserves it! - It's for you, Ms. Schatzi. Hello? Yes, this is she. Who? What's the matter? - It's Pops. - What about Pops? - He's passed? - Where? Out. This makes me feel a little queer. Yeah, me, too. It makes me realize how fond I was of Pops. Me, too. Oh, I'm going to miss Pops something terrible. Me, too. You? - Any objection to me missing Pops? - Yes, I have. Why? Well, it don't seem respectful to his memory. Oh, is that so! - Me? - Yes, you. How did I ever take advantage of Pops? Were you after anything but his money? Your nerve! And when I think I could've saved him from you, if I'd had the time... You? Save Pops from me? - Maybe it isn't too late yet. - Too late for what? For me to get busy. Call out the reserves. Get him in a white suit. And leave you holding the bag! Wait! Wait! Come here a minute! Take this thing off my head! What are you going to do? Come here! Will you come in, please? If you ladies will sit down, I'll call Mr. Garrish. Pardon me. I don't like this. But you've got to go through with it. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Which is Ms. Sidreau? - I am. This is Ms. Gwen. I've heard both your names. This is a painful occasion, ladies. My client, and your late friend, as you know, Ms. Sidreau... ... was a man who, all his life, did things his own way. Are you trying to tell me something's wrong? No, my dear lady, not a thing. Only a little ceremony... ... for which my client left most strict instructions. - Is the other lady ready? - Yes. What other lady? Just a moment, please. Show her in. Come in, please. Will you sit there, Ms. Lawrence? You may proceed. 'Being sound in health and body, I wish to make a few remarks to supplement... ... what I have already put in writing.' Oh, poor Pops, he has a cold. He had a cold. 'I have, in late years, been associated with three young women... ... known as Jean, Schatzi and Polaire. For Polaire, I have only the highest, but most disinterested esteem. I have embodied my feelings for Schatzi in my will. I take this means, however, in warning my executives against the scheming of the one named Jean.' That's a lie! 'I knew you'd say that. Sit down.' Is there anything else, madame? No, I don't think so. What do you want, Schatzi? A large club. Say, well, that's stupid. We're ordering breakfast. Try to have it here before the middle of the afternoon. Yes, madame. Can you beat that? A 'yes, madame' waiter, and a 'yes, ma'am' menu. I'm glad I told Dey to bring his father here this afternoon and not for lunch. Would it be a terrible mistake if they came for dinner? Not a chance. They'll be here this afternoon at four. Hello? What do you want? It's Jean. What do you want to see us about? Well, make it some other time. I'm busy this afternoon. Alright, then, three o'clock. Will that be all, madame? That's all. Scram. Yes, madame. No, no. Wait a minute. Is that all the clothes you've got? I don't think I understand you, madame. Well, have you got a real butler suit? Can you get a real butler suit? - Yes, madame. - Very well, then. Gee. You're going to be our butler for about half an hour this afternoon. When that dame shows up, we'll show her a family to her tainted little nuthead, our house. That's great. She won't get over that for a year. You be back here at three o'clock with that butler suit and serve tea. We won't want you for long. Now, you understand? Yes, madame. Is this Ms. Sidreau's apartment? - Yes, it is. - Well, is she in? I'll see if she's at home, miss. What name shall I say? Lawrence. Won't you be seated, miss? Just a moment. By any chance, is your name Meadows? No, miss. Herbert Scroggins. That's all I wanted to know. Well, well, well! Indeed, my dear. How are you? No one knows. Well, if you came here to be imposing! I can come here with a handful of calling cards. Jean, my dear! Oh, it's simply wonderful to see you again. You're looking too marvelous yourself, my dear, believe it or not. Why, we're forgetting. Jean hasn't had her tea yet. - Shall I call Jones, Schatzi? - Why not? Oh, here he is now. How were all the other slaves on the old plantation, Herbert? Well, there you have me, ma'am. - Shall I pour? - If you will. Cream? No. How wise she is not to take cream. You're two or three pounds to the good, aren't you? That's a cute little jacket. - This? - Yes. Where did you get it? I shot it in me own kitchen. Where did you get that thing you're wearing? Oh, this? The man who made it is so well-known you've never even heard of him. Oh! Pardon I... - Oh, chinchilla! - It don't last til you get it home. Yeah? Well, it lasted til it got home to me! Look. Got these since I saw you last. They're real. I knew they were. I can always tell real pearls. Even when they're such little ones. Oh, is that so! Well, some of these aren't so little. And some of them aren't so real, are they? Oh, is that so! Well, I didn't come here to be high-hatted, and nobody gets away with it - Well, what did you come here for? I came here because I made up my mind you better be told where you get off. Nobody gets away with double-crossing me! We weren't double-crossing you! Now, don't tell me you didn't put Pops up to that phonograph gag. No, Jean, I swear - And I suppose you didn't take Dey Emery away from me just as I got stuck on him... ... and only I gave him up, you said I could have him. Well, I didn't want to give him up, and you knew it anyway, didn't you? Oh, nevermind what I did. Hello? Oh, yes, dear. When? Now? Well, alright. - You've got to go. - I've got to what? Go. They're on their way. They just telephoned. Yeah, you got to go. We got business here this afternoon and it's private business. Well, is it so private you can't let an old friend in on it? Yes, Jean, I'm sorry, but it is. Well, that's what I call carrying things too far. Keeping secrets from your oldest friend! Throwing your oldest friend out into the street. - I'm sorry, Jean. - Oh, why should I be interested anyway? - Oh, Jean, for the love of - - Not to you. - I'll have to tell her. - Oh, no, no! Don't tell me! Oh, no! Don't tell me! It's so private, don't think of telling me! What is it? I'm going to be married. You're going to be married? Who to? Well, now, I don't want to talk about it, but... Dey Emery. You're going to marry Dey Emery? Yes. And he's bringing his father here. Now? Yes, to look me over. And, well, you see, Jean, Dey wouldn't want anyone else here. Oh! Oh, I see. Well, why not let the old man look us all over? Oh, no. No, I'd rather not. Oh. Well, of course, if that's the way you feel about it... It's alright with me. Well, anyhow, let's all have a little drinky, just for good luck! Nobody has a little drinky here until this is all over, and that's that! Well, alright, I'll go. I'll do more than that. I'll take back all I said. Now, look, we're old friends. I always liked you two guys. Now, this is no time for hard feelings. Let's shake. You're a great scaff, Jean. - You're no slouch yourself. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll be seeing you. - Oh, Jean? - What? Just a moment. Here are your gloves. Take them with you, so you don't have to come back after them. Thanks. Are you sure you got everything? You didn't tie the horse and buggy around here, did you? Oh, Polaire? How about taking your wedding present from me now? - Oh, Jean! - Yes, why not? - Oh, you're crazy! - No, I want you to have them! That's my - - Oh, no, I couldn't possibly! - But I want you to have them! I'm sorry you didn't get me out in time. Hello, darling. - Where's your father? - Isn't he coming? Oh, he preferred that I brought her to him. You don't mind, darling, do you? Oh, alright. I'm scared, but I don't mind. I'll get your coat. I feel just like a mama, which I hope you'll appreciate. I do. How do you do, Mr. Emery? Oh, how do you do? - I believe 'congratulations' are in order. - Yes, they are. Yes, I haven't seen you since the day of the big wind. Here's your hat and coat. I don't know why I should be so excited about a wedding... ... when I think of all the times I could've gotten married. Here. Good luck, old dear. - Thanks, Jean, for everything. - Don't mention it. Come on, Polaire. - I want my bad dime. - Why? Well, you know why. She's cuckoo enough to believe in the old thing. - So am I. - You don't want your bad dime. Come on. I really don't want to go without my bad dime, honestly - Now, Ms. Towhead. You can have your little drinky. I'll open up a pint for you. Pint? What teetotaler ever invented pints? Did you break anything? No, but I will. Now, you wait here and I'll go find Father. I'm scared. I know he'll think I'm not half good enough for you. Oh, darling! Ms. Gwen, my father. - How do you do, Ms. Gwen? - How do you do, Mr. Emery? - Hey. - What? - Come here. - Just a minute. - What? - You join us later. - I want to - - Nevermind. - Father - - You wait right there. You see, Ms. Gwen, I wanted a few minutes with you alone. - Will you give me some tea? - Why, yes, of course. Strong, with cream and sugar. Well, I'll open another pint. They're Polaire's but she won't mind. - I've had enough. - You've had what? I've had enough. I'm going home. Why, I never knew you to stop on one drink before! Call me a taxi, please. I'll be right down. - What are you up to? - Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. - Where are your pearls? - My pearls? - Oh, Polaire's got them. - Polaire gave them back to you. - I don't think so. - Why, I saw her! - Well, I haven't got them, have I? - You must have put them down someplace. Well, why don't you keep them? Say, I can't understand why you're so careless about real pearls. But why should I worry? They're safe here, aren't they? - You're up to something. - What would I be up to? I don't know. But you aren't going to leave this place til you find those pearls! A great fortune needs a serious master. That's why I can't leave my money to my son. Can't you? Dey hasn't shown himself very serious. I've never cared about money. You see? They're not here. Oh, they must be here. I saw Polaire give them back to you. I was standing right there, first one to... ... not around... Jean! Hello? Hello, Operator. Operator, now get this. Ms. Lawrence is on her way downstairs for a taxicab. You send an elevator boy out to get the address she gives the driver. And I'll wait here. I'm glad Dey's made up his mind to marry at last. - No matter whom? - So long as she marries him for himself. Not for his money. I didn't realize Dey would be giving up so much. Oh, not that I mind for myself. But it's hard on him. No, it's good for him to want anyone as much as he wants you. Now that I've seen you, I shan't interfere. Thank you. - Shall we call Dey now? - Yes, please do. Hello? What's that address? What? Call me a taxi. I'm sorry to barge in, but I'm afraid I've left you my pearls. I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I have mistakenly given you my pearls. You'll pardon me, won't you. I must trouble you for my pearls. This dame is nuts! You're a great scout, Father. When can we get married? Isn't that for the young lady to say? - Oh, I'm ready anytime. - Darling... I beg your pardon, sir. There is a Ms. Lawrence here, asking to see Ms. Gwen. - Ms. Lawrence? - Jean! A friend of yours? Oh, yes. Can she wait somewhere? She says her business is most urgent, miss. Well, ask the young lady to come in. Alright. Will you come this way, please? It just kills me to make this interruption, but I'm afraid I have to trouble you for my... Oh... Oh, I beg your pardon. Ms. Lawrence, my father. How do you do? How do you do? I thought you said you had urgent business here, Jean. Yes, it can wait. Why did you go down this street? It's alright lady, it's the traffic. I know it's the traffic. Why don't you go through the park? Oh, it's just the same anyplace you go, lady. Don't look to me about this traffic. Quite, indeed. Yes, it must have been at Ole Cal's Vanity. Oh, but I have never been to Ole Cal's Vanity. No? Perhaps it was the polo at Westminster Biltmore. Or perhaps it was the opera? I don't think so. Well, the horse show? - Maybe... - Well, it must have been someplace. You are good-looking, you know, and I never forget a face. Is that all you came to say, Jean? Well, isn't that an alright thing to say? Sure. Only you came a long way to say it. - Oh, I know where it was! - I beg your pardon! - I know where I saw you before! - Where? - In the movies. - The movies? - What are you talking about? - Yes, yes. It was about a year ago. - Oh, she means the newsreel. - Yes. Yes, you were in a little boat, getting off your yacht. How do you remember that? Oh, I never forget a yacht. - Pardon, sir. - Yes, Billings, what is it? There's a Ms. Sidreau here, asking for Ms. Lawrence. Schatzi! - What does she want? - Another friend? Why, yes, but don't ask her in. We'd better go. Come on, Jean. Just a moment! What's your hurry? Billings, ask the young lady to wait. I've just come! - I'm sure Mr. Emery doesn't want - - Well, maybe he doesn't, but I do. - Now, look here, Jean - - What is there to get so excited about, darling? Well, that's what I don't know. But Jean's here for no good, or Schatzi wouldn't come. You'll be sorry you pulled that one, baby. My, dear, Ms. Lawrence! Where are my pearls? How should I know where your pearls are? - Did you have her pearls? - Certainly she had them! Well, what were you doing with them? That's a long story, and I hate long stories. I'll tell you what she was doing with them. She wanted to wear them here, so you wouldn't think she was a gold-digger. Jean, you've got genius! I'm sorry, Mr. Emery, but they were real pearls, and real pearls are worth money. Of course, she may be playing a joke. I don't know - The one who plays a joke is you, and it's gone far enough. She's trying to make me out a thief. I never thought of such a thing! You must be crazy! I'm not crazy, and I'm not a thief. I gave you back those pearls and you know it perfectly well. Why, Schatzi saw me do it. Schatzi! Well, all this is most embarrassing to me. Come on in here with me, Schatzi. There's going to be trouble. Oh, I knew it. Schatzi saw me give her those pearls back. - Sure, I did. - Well, I haven't got them, have I? Of all the low-down frame-ups! You know perfectly well those pearls are in your bag right this minute. Oh, are they? Alright! Well, are they here? Are they there? Well, you must have them somewhere on you. Well, search me, then. This is a grave charge you've made, Ms. Lawrence. It's a grave charge they've made against me! Fancy me, framing an old friend! Couldn't they have fallen inside your dress? I think you'd better look. Do you? Alright, I will. - Well, I'll help you. - No, thanks. No, I'll search myself. Now, watch closely, Mr. Emery. See that I don't pull any tricks. Look, are they there? Is it there? Is it there? Are they there? Now are you satisfied? - What are you laughing at? - Now we'll search Polaire. - Oh, I wouldn't, if I were you. - Well, she's got to be cleared! Not Jean's way, I couldn't! Well, we don't have to go that far with it. Ms. Gwen. - You knew, you! - Polaire, dear. - So you didn't give them back. - Oh, of course I gave them back, and she - Dey, what are you thinking? Well, I'm thinking this is the rottenest, vilest mess I've ever seen. I see. Well, you better think more than that, Dey, and be quick about it. Vile is the word for this thing. It is a rotten, vile mess but that's what you get for playing around with our kind. I'm glad it happened now instead of later. I must have been crazy to think of marrying you! Polaire! Polaire! Polaire! Come back... Where has she gone? Has she gone to your place? I'd give her time to cool off if I were you. And if I were you... - What? - I'd get back to my father! What? In the presence of the family and intimate friends... ... including the Duke and Duchess of Einsley... ... the Duchess being Mr. Emery's daughter by a former marriage. Mr. Dey Emery will act as his father's best man. Have you the ring, Mr. Dey? Yes, I've got the ring. And the bride will be given away by her mother. Oh, pardon me. Just a moment. Yes, my love. I don't know why it is, but I don't seem to be able to remember my mother's name. Your mother is Mrs. Randolph Hill, of Kansas City. Your father is Colonel Randolph Hill of Kansas City. My father's dead. Your mother's husband may be dead. Your father is Colonel Randolph Hill of Kansas City. Well, anyhow... Now, sir, about placing the string quartet. Oh, yes, I'll come at once. - Excuse me, dear. Come with me, Dey. - Yes, Father. Pardon me. Georgette, dearie, come here. In here, please. Hey, wait a minute. We didn't come for the wedding. We came to see Ms. Lawrence. And we'll see Ms. Lawrence. Oh. Will you wait in the library, ladies? I'll tell Ms. Lawrence that you are here. But who shall I say? Ms. Sears, and Ms. Buck. Of Sears Roebuck. Are you sure you want to go through with this? I want my bad dime back and I'm going to get it. Now, right here, the bride's alone. Are you ready, Ms. Lawrence? - Yes, I'm - - Come on, don't keep the party waiting here. Say, listen. Do you think there are any detectives around here to put us out? No, if there are any, they'll be drinking to the bride's health. Of all the snow thieves! Say, cut out the personal remarks, and tell me what you two guys are doing here! I want my bad dime. Yeah, Jean, give it to her, so she won't be so nervous on the water. Water? What water? We're going to Paris! Paris? Yeah! We're taking the Isle de France, too. - When? - Today. About the time you're being made an honest woman. Oh, gee, that's great, isn't it? Sure, it's great. So if you don't mind coming across... Sure, I'll come across! Georgette, give me one of those boxes, here. French, as she is spoke. Ten lessons for ten cents. I've had all the luck I could stand just now. I don't know what to do with it anymore. - I bet you'll have fun in Paris, huh? - That's what we're going for. Yeah, when people have fun together, that's something, isn't it? Sometimes I think that's all there is. So do I. Sometimes. You always liked that kind of junk, Jean. Couldn't you have gotten some good preferred stock instead? - Here. - Thanks. - It brought me lots of luck. - I'll say! I guess it was luck. Let's have a little drinky, just to say goodbye. - I don't see why not. - Alright, I'll raise! Oh, just what we wanted! That's fine. Mr. Dey asked me to tell you that the guests are arriving, Ms. Lawrence. Alright, that's fine, thanks. To gay Paris. How long are you staying over? Oh, as long as the staying's good. We haven't made any plans except for catching the boat, and we have to step on it to do that. Let's have one more little drinky on our late friend. - Before we bury her. - What do you mean, bury me? I mean bury you. So when those two Italian aviators said to me, 'Why don't we all go to Paris?' I said, 'Sure, why don't we all go to Paris?' So, we're all going to Paris. And if they only own half of what they say, they own everything in Paris... ... except one little bridge across the river. Yeah, well, we're sailing, too. - Yes? - On Mr. Emery's yacht. Oh, well, now you're not going to tell us that Emery's yacht can sail to France. Why, they've got lifeboats bigger than his whole boat! And we're going to our own island for our honeymoon. Mr. Emery owns all of it. You know, real estate's a poor investment. And what if you want some chop suey at 2 a.m.? Mr. Emery says it's very romantic. And there's lots of quail on our island. You can get plenty of quail in Paris. Yeah, well, I've got something you can't get in Paris. - What? - I've got one million dollars. - Is it real? - In my own name, in my own bank. A million's not enough for a girl who sacrifices everything and pulls straight. - Well, Jean always did like money. - Yes. Not as much as I like palling around with you two guys. Well, then, what are you marrying for then anyway? Well, why did you want to marry Dey? Well, that was different. She liked the poor sap. Yeah. He was a fine one, he was! - Now you lay off Dey! - Well, anyhow! Anyhow! All how! Who was that? - It's the three of us. - Against the men. I'm sorry I pulled that pearl trick on you. - We won't talk about that. - No, we won't talk about that. Anyhow, it got me someplace. It wasn't that. It was my bad dime. - Oh, look at all the people! - Oh, where do you think they're going? Maybe it's a fire! It reminds me... What? It reminds me when I was... I lived next door to a firehouse... I'm sorry. I'm not so sorry for you as I am for myself. I'm going to go get married and be stuck on an island with nothing but a big quail. Why can't I have some fun? I'm still young, I'm still beautiful. I have everything. My mistake is giving up my good times for that old fluff. Young girls all just have to savor their mistakes. Poor Jean, she wishes she was going to Paris with us. Doesn't she, Jean? Well, maybe I do. Without the fellow. Oh, yes. Well, I'm glad we're going with us. Just grows wild. Yeah, goodbye, Jean. - What? - Goodbye. You're mumbling. I'm not mumbling. We'll see you off when you're all covered with quail. Whenever we eat one. We got to go. - No, no. Don't go. - We got to. Now, come on, honey. You buck up. Oh, we can't leave you like this. No! You can't! Don't leave me like this! Take me with you! Oh, take me! You can't leave me here! You've got to get married. Well, when you got a million and all that junk, why give a hunk? - Why give a hunk? - That's what I say! Come on, let's go! Can't go out there. There's people. Come on, we'll go out that door. Come on, let's get my jewelry. Polaire! You two go on. I'll meet you at the taxi. Well, what is this to you about? You might've listened to me. I have so much to tell you and I won't be any good until I've said it. Well, at least give me the satisfaction of telling you that I can't get you out of my mind? I'll go in there and make sure myself. Oh, please, sir. It is very unlucky for the bridegroom to speak to the bride before the ceremony. Oh, I'm too old for that nonsense and the guests are waiting. Hold that door out there! I don't like these old-fashioned locks! Car! What is it? Are you nearly ready, my love? Am I ready? Yes, I'll be ready in two minutes! - I'll get your coat. - Where's my dress? Where's my dress? More or less never bothered you before. Take this, take this. What's that? It sounds bad! Come on! - Can't you forgive me? - Sure, I forgive you! - Well, if you forgive me... - No, it stops there. Marry a nice girl, Dey, and get a horse. We can't talk here now. You've got to let me see you again. - Dey! - Come find me! Polaire! - Polaire, come back! - Dey! Father, I love her. - No. My boy, there's trouble out there. - I know there's trouble out there. The roughest corset I ever had. Oh, you! You would stop to talk to that sap! - Don't you call him a sap! - Now quit scrappling and come on! - Hurry up! - Come on! - No, you know Jean - - What about Jean? - I don't know. She's lost to me. She's gone! - Gone where? I don't know! Dey, what do you think? - What does it mean? - I don't know. But I'm going to find out. Oh, I'm blind. I'm drunk. I'll never be the same. Oh, the jewels! Where are the jewels! Did you get them? Oh, I'll be pained for this. I wish I'd never gone to that house. I wish I hadn't seen him. I love him and I'm never going to see him again. Drive right through that next traffic stop. If I drive through the light, they'll pinch me. If you don't drive through the light, I'll kill you. Take your choice. Whoever came into gentlermans that you two! - But why? - Well, you dared me to find you. - Yes, but now what? - Well, you told me to marry a nice girl. I'm not a nice girl. I'm not a nice girl! I'm not a nice girl! You've always said that, and I've never believed you. Hey, you! You know, I ought to give you a good balling- out for walking out on your father's wedding. You should ball him out? Sure! Wasn't I almost his mama? Hey, isn't that my bracelet? - Sure, it's the bracelet Pops lent me. - Oh, Jean, for the love of Pete! - Well, it looks like it. - About that trip to Rome... - Well... - You can have the bracelet. You know, I'm sure I've met you before. You know, I never forget a face, and you are good-looking, you know. Come here, I want to talk...
